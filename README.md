# psion-organiser-2-emulator
Curses based Psion Organiser 2 emulator

This is a simple Psion Organiser 2 emulator written in C that uses the curses library for output. It is the emulator
I used when developing the emulator that ended up in the Psion Organiser recreation.

You can embed any ROM image from XP or LZ and it should work. I haven't used the emulator for much other
than the LZ 4.2 ROM but most ROMs should work.
