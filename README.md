# psion-organiser-2-emulator
Curses based Psion Organiser 2 emulator

This is a simple Psion Organiser 2 emulator written in C that uses the curses library for output. It is the emulator
I used when developing the emulator that ended up in the Psion Organiser recreation.

It runs with the 33 LA ROM image but can't handle the LZ images as they use bank switching.
